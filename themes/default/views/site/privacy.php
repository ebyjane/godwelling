        <ul>
        	<li><strong>Advertisers:</strong> We may allow third parties to use Cookies on the Site to collect the same type of information for the same purposes as GoDwelling does for itself. They may be able to associate the information they collect with other information they have about you from other sources. We do not necessarily have access to or control over the Cookies they use.

     <h3>Controlling Your Personal Data</h3>
     <p>Other users may be able to identify you, or associate you with your account if you include personal information in the content you post publicly. You can reduce the risk of being personally identified by using the Site pseudonymously, though doing so could detract from the credibility of your contributions to the Site. Users can also use the Member Search feature to find one another based on their names or email addresses. </p>
     <p>Please also note that the messages you send or receive using the Site are only private to the extent that both you and the sender/recipient keep them private. For example, we do not have any control over whether a recipient of one of your messages publicly posts it or its contents. Similarly, GoDwelling may also access such messages in the course of investigations relating to Site use.</p>
     
     <h3>Data Retention and Account Termination</h3>
     <p>You can close your account by clicking <a href="#">here</a>(contact). We will remove your public posts from view and/or dissociate them from your account profile, but we may retain information about you for the purposes authorized under this Privacy Policy unless prohibited by law. For example, we may retain information to prevent, investigate, or identify possible wrongdoing in connection with the Site or to comply with legal obligations. Please note that businesses cannot remove their business listings, ratings or reviews by closing their accounts.</p>
     
     <h3>Children</h3>

However, no method of transmission over the Internet or via mobile device, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure.
